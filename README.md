Things made with the P5JS Processing


## Water Bend
In this project I tried to create something like a power to control water, using forces like gravity and air resistence to create something more physically accurate, and also checking the colission of the particles with each other to create repulsive forces

## Fireworks
In this project, with every tick there is a chance that a firework will be generated, which will go up to a random height and then explode into a lot of particles. To make the particle system look better, there is gravity and some other forces applied to them


## Fractal Tree
In this project, a tree is created of a series of branches, and the branch itself is defined recursivly, making the tree continue itself for a period determined by the length of the final branch. I also created a slider from witch the angle between new branches can be defined, creating a nice effect
